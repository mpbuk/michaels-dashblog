# michaels-dashblog
My first build of a responsive blog theme as part of Dash by General Assembly. 

It pulls together what I have learnt so far in HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

Which inludes HTML tags to differentiate between headers, images, 2nd headers, articles and paragraphs. 
Also the use of CSS to add differnt styles to the code and make the page more enjoyable to look at and interact with. 
Finally, the inclusion of Javascript makes the 'Like' buttons interactive.
